Hello, I am Duke and I will help you remember the tasks you need to do!
For now, you can do the following:
Add a task using: add <description> -d <deadline>
List all tasks using: list
Mark a task as done using: mark <index>
Mark a task as undone using: unmark <index>
Edit a task deadline using: editdeadline <index> -d <deadline>
Exit the program using: bye

No save file was found. Creating a new list and save file 'data.txt' for you to use.
See you again, bye!
